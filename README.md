# Student-record-management-system-SRMS
The Student Record Management System is a  C program that helps store and manage basic student details. It keeps information like roll number, name, and marks in text files so that the data is saved even after the program is closed. Using files instead of just variables makes the data permanent and lets the system work more like a real application.
